# David Blue's GitHub Repository Template

Howdy! I'm new to all of this and yet I've already grown quite tired of things like Labels not being set up the way I prefer, so I created this template for myself. It is very much a work in progress. I've left it public just in case it'd be of use to anyone else, and I hope it is! If there's any way I can catalyze that, please do reach out!
